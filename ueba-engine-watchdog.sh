# CyberSentinel UEBA — engine liveness watchdog (heartbeat-based).
#
# Catches the "silent stall": the engine process stays alive (so systemd
# Restart= never fires) but its feed-processing loop wedges, freezing output
# while fresh logs keep arriving. That is the 2026-08-01 ~6h incident.
#
# LIVENESS SIGNAL — the engine's Stats heartbeat, NOT alert recency.
# The engine emits a "Stats | processed: N ..." line every ~60s WHENEVER it is
# looping, independent of whether any alert fired. So:
#   * healthy but quiet (few/no alerts)  -> heartbeat keeps advancing  -> OK
#   * genuinely stalled (loop wedged)    -> heartbeat goes stale       -> RESTART
# A previous version keyed off newest_alert_time (<300s) and thus false-restarted
# a healthy engine during every quiet alert period. Do NOT reintroduce that.
#
# Confirmed real stall requires ALL of:
#   1. engine process is active (else systemd is already handling it — but we
#      still restart to be safe if it's not active),
#   2. the FEED is fresh (enriched.jsonl mtime < FEED_FRESH_SECS) — there IS work,
#   3. the Stats heartbeat is stale (last "Stats |" log line > STALE_SECS old),
#   4. the processed counter has NOT advanced since the previous probe.
#
# Flap protection: <=1 restart / MIN_RESTART_GAP. Forensic snapshot before acting.
